# weather_station
This repository contains a collection of scripts and code for a arduino based weather station approach for the FACT Weatherstation as wel as some documentation.


# Hardware

## Temperatur Sensor: DHT22
The DHT22 is a basic, low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding air, and spits out a digital signal on the data pin (no analog input pins needed)

For details see: https://www.adafruit.com/product/385
Documentation: https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Temperature/DHT22.pdf
Ardunio Library for the DHT22: https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library

The design for our weatherstation is based un this instruction: http://fluuux.de/2012/10/arduino-temperatur-und-luftfeuchtigkeit-mit-dem-dht22-prufen/


## Rainsensor: Hydreon RG 11
Tipping bucket example: http://cactus.io/hookups/weather/rain/hydreon/hookup-arduino-to-hydreon-rg-11-rain-sensor

In tipping bucket mode 0.01mm the Sensor produces a 100ms pulse for each detected bucket switch.

## Windsensors:

### Anemometer
The Anemometer measures via closing contact. 2.4 km/h windspeed cause the contact to close once per second.

### Wind Vane:
For the wind vane a a 15k resistor is used resulting in the following directions, 0Â° points away from the Anemometer:

| Direction / Degrees | Resistance / Ohms| Voltage / V (V=5v, R=15k) |
| --- | ---   | --- |
| 0   |       |4.52|
|22.5 |       |3.80|
|45   |       |4.16|
|67.5 |       |3.09|
|90   |       |3.56|
|112.5|       |1.63|
